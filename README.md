Data Mining Research about Fannie Mae

Hello!
This is Ziyan Lin, a graduate student from Johns Hopkins University, majoring in applied math and statistics.

In this repository, there is a group project developed by two different parts based on Fannie Mae dataset. The first part is classification method, and the second part is Markov Chain analysis. Group members are Ziyan Lin, Tianqi Cui, Ruoxi Liu, and Kexin Wang.

Fannie Mae provides loan performance dataset. The primary dataset is divided into two text files for each acquisition quarter, starting in 2000. The “Acquisition” file includes static mortgage loan data at the time of the mortgage loan’s origination and delivery to Fannie Mae. The “Performance” file provides the monthly performance data of each mortgage loan since the time of Fannie Mae’s acquisition up until its current status. The datasets are available here https://.loanperformancedata.fanniemae.com/lppub/index.html.

Tianqi and I are fcous on classification part. We merge files, preprocess
